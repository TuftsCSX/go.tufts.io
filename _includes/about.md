# [Tufts.io](http://tufts.io)
A searchable archive of practical projects and resources at Tufts.

### What is go.tufts.io and what are "go links"?
In essence, tufts.io is a searchable link-forwarder for tufts projects and resources.

Originally, all of the link-forwarding action lived on a separate site, go.tufts.io.  tufts.io was originally supposed to represent a greater spirit of practical learning and go.tufts.io was to be a supporting tool.  However, as time went on, I realized that go.tufts.io actually achieved a lot of what tufts.io wanted.  People started creating links to projects and resources that they cared about.  So if these were searchable, there could be a search engine for tufts projects and resources.

Furthermore, I had previously hoped to create an internal linking shortcut so that go/csx would work on tufts wifi.  However, as of November, 2016, EECS has officially declined to enable the feature, citing other priorities.  

### Advantages over link-forwarders (eg: [bit.ly](http://bit.ly)):

* Links can be maintained and edited (bit.ly links are permanent)
* Your project is searchable on [tufts.io/posts](/posts)
* [tufts.io](/) will be (hopefully) recognizably associated with Tufts projects / groups.
* Pick a simple, relavant url instead of something like bit.ly/TuftsSomethingGroupFall2016

### Examples use cases:

* tufts.io/yourname goes to your personal website / github
* Projects you worked on that belong to other organizations (eg: Jumbo Code)
* Important google docs such as pitch decks and budget sheets (eg: [tufts.io/register](http://tufts.io/register))
* Facebook groups and events
* Wireframe and prototype links (eg: invision)
* Projects on Github
* PDF of your thesis
* Article hosted on another website
* PDF / Google doc of your resume
* Imgur link to a photoshopped Ming ([/ming](http://tufts.io/ming) is taken, but feel free to suggest a new end site)

This is mimicking the internal link systems of some large companies such as Google ("go/") and Microsoft ("//").  Try [tufts.io/csx](http://tufts.io/csx) to see it in action, or search "csx" at [tufts.io](http://tufts.io)

### Purpose of [Tufts.io](http://tufts.io)
Tufts.io is a website that's meant for people who want to build practical things.  The focus is also to provide alternatives to four trends at Tufts:

1. Going to a large company (Google, Apple, Microsoft) is perceived as the epitome of success, while creating your own project or working for a smaller, more focused company is perceived as a failure.
2. CS, ELS, Design, and other disciplinaries rarely work together, but almost all successful projects from Tufts have been interdisciplinary.
3. Opportunities to gain practical experience at Tufts are limited
4. Building anything is discouraged unless the idea is worth a billion dollars.

The purpose isn't to discourage people from going to larger companies or to force people to work across disciplines, but to make it easier for people who are interested in trying.

### History of the [Tufts.io](http://tufts.io) domain

Originally purchased to create a Tufts entrepreneurial network, tufts.io was passed down to [Tom Wang](http://www.womtang.me/) and then [Alex Lenail](http://alexlenail.me), who wanted to support individuals building things for the Tufts CS community.  During this time, the site hosted events such as [Polyhack](http://2015.polyhack.tufts.io) and [Tamper Nights](https://www.facebook.com/events/715024135262599/)

The domain is currently owned by [Richard Kim](http://cwrichardkim.com), who is expanding the project to be a more permanent resource to anyone who is interested in building things at Tufts.  Other members currently include [Max Bernstein](http://bernsteinbear.com/) and [Bruno Olmedo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-olmedo-aa1188a5).

### [Tufts.io](http://tufts.io) and CSX
Tufts.io is a partner group of [CSX](http://tuftscsx.com), focusing more heavily on practical projects for individuals.  It's likely that the two groups will share members, but they are officially different entities and all collaboration is done through a mutual partnership.
