# [Tufts.io](http://tufts.io)
An attempt to encourage practical and interdisciplinary projects at Tufts.

---

### What is go.tufts.io and what are "go links"?
go.tufts.io is a very simple link forwarder, and "go links" are the shorthand for one of the links on this site.  For example, [go.tufts.io/csx](http://go.tufts.io/csx) forwards to tuftscsx.com and [go.tufts.io/11](http://go.tufts.io/11) forwards to the comp11 website.

Advantages over other link-forwarders (eg: [bit.ly](http://bit.ly)):

* Links can be maintained and edited (bit.ly links are permanent)
* Your project is searchable on [go.tufts.io/posts](/posts)
* [go.tufts.io](/) will be (hopefully) recognizably associated with Tufts projects / groups.
* Pick a simple, relavant url instead of something like bit.ly/TuftsSomethingGroupFall2016

Examples of useful link ideas:

* go.tufts.io/yourname goes to your personal website / github
* Projects you worked on that belong to other organizations (eg: Jumbo Code)
* Important google docs such as pitch decks and budget sheets (eg: [go.tufts.io/register](http://go.tufts.io/register))
* Facebook groups and events
* Wireframe and prototype links (eg: invision)
* Projects on Github
* PDF of your thesis
* Article hosted on another website
* PDF / Google doc of your resume
* Imgur link to a photoshopped Ming ([/ming](http://go.tufts.io/ming) is available!)

This is mimicking the internal link systems of some large companies such as Google ("go/") and Microsoft ("//").  Try [go.tufts.io/csx](http://go.tufts.io/csx) to see it in action.

### Purpose of [Tufts.io](http://tufts.io)
Tufts.io is a website that's meant for people who want to build practical things.  The focus is also to provide alternatives to four trends at Tufts:

1. Going to a large company (Google, Apple, Microsoft) is perceived as the epitome of success, while creating your own project or working for a smaller, more focused company is perceived as a failure.
2. CS, ELS, Design, and other disciplinaries rarely work together, but almost all successful projects from Tufts have been interdisciplinary.
3. Opportunities to gain practical experience at Tufts are limited
4. Building anything is discouraged unless the idea is worth a billion dollars.

The purpose isn't to discourage people from going to larger companies or to force people to work across disciplines, but to make it easier for people who are interested in trying.

### History of the [Tufts.io](http://tufts.io) domain

Originally purchased to create a Tufts entrepreneurial network, tufts.io was passed down to [Tom Wang](http://www.womtang.me/) and then [Alex Lenail](http://alexlenail.me), who wanted to support individuals building things for the Tufts CS community.  During this time, the site hosted events such as [Polyhack](http://2015.polyhack.tufts.io) and [Tamper Nights](https://www.facebook.com/events/715024135262599/)

The domain is currently owned by [Richard Kim](http://cwrichardkim.com), who is expanding the project to be a more permanent resource to anyone who is interested in building things at Tufts.  Other members currently include [Max Bernstein](http://bernsteinbear.com/) and [Bruno Olmedo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-olmedo-aa1188a5).

### [Tufts.io](http://tufts.io) and CSX
Tufts.io is a partner group of [CSX](http://tuftscsx.com), focusing more heavily on practical projects for individuals.  It's likely that the two groups will share members, but they are officially different entities and all collaboration is done through a mutual partnership.
